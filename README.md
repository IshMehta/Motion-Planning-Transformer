Recent strides being made in autonomous robotics has led to researchers putting more emphasis on fast and ef- ficient motion planning algorithms. A popular choice for these are sampling-based motion planning algorithms (SMP). Such algorithms aim to construct a path by generating trees or graphs by randomly sampling points from start location to goal location, with one of the most popular algorithms being Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT). While these work quite well, there is a major issue with them. They do not scale well in terms of compu- tation with increasing environment sizes. Previous efforts have been made to restrict the search space for generating the shortest path, but these methods are based on robot kinematics which make them hard to generalize. There are other efforts based on convolution neural networks and multi layer perceptrons however these are heavily depen- dent on environment sizes. Thus, we need an algorithm that can scale with the map size, while still maintaining reason- able computation times. Over the last few years, we have seen applications of transformer based models in nat- ural language processing are able to scale efficiently and deal with high dimensional data simultaneously. Thus, in this project we will try to re-implement the Motion Plan- ning Transformer (MPT) - a transformer based model to help reduce search space in 2-dimensional environments for SMP algorithm.
